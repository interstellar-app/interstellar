# Interstellar

An app for Kbin; connecting you to the fediverse.

## Installation

At the moment, Interstellar can be tested on both Linux and Android (you could also build from source for other platforms). You'll find the latest build files [here](https://github.com/jwr1/interstellar/releases/latest).

## Discussion

You can ask questions, report bugs, or make suggestions either here on [GitHub](https://github.com/jwr1/interstellar/issues), or in the [interstellar magazine](https://kbin.earth/m/interstellar). You can also join the [matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#kbin-interstellar:matrix.org) for real time discussion.

## Contributing

Interstellar uses [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) as its framework, so make sure you have the [Flutter SDK installed](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) before doing anything else. Then, run `flutter doctor -v` to see instructions for setting up different build platforms (e.g. android studio for APKs). Once that's done, you can use `flutter run` to develop, and `flutter build {platform}` for release files.
